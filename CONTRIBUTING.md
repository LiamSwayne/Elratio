## Congratulations, you've been selected to participate in the highly selective Elratio improvement program!

To contribute to the language, suggest a feature in [issues](https://github.com/LiamSwayne/Elratio/issues) or make a [pull request](https://github.com/LiamSwayne/Elratio/pulls) implementing a feature that has been given the go ahead.

We currently only accept changes to [source.py](https://github.com/LiamSwayne/Elratio/blob/main/source.py). From there, the builder generates the program template and assigns a version number at random!

Standards:
- No external modules (numpy, pandas, etc).
- No internal modules (time, random, etc).
