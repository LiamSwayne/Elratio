A Python-based programming language that combines the performance of Ruby with the readability of Perl.

> "The solution to Assembly"

To write your own Elratio program, download [template.py](template.py) and write your program in the indicated space.

# Features
Elratio provides numerous advantages over every other language!

## Bold new whitespace
No modern language provides indication that an empty line is empty. Elratio takes whitespace in a bold new direction with the `empty` keyword.
###### Python/Java/R/C/Go/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
empty;
```
Elratio does not permit blank lines. Every empty line must contain the keyword `empty`.

## Improved printing syntax
Python uses the unclear syntax `print()` to print. Elratio uses `systemOutPrint()` for clarity.
<pre>
print(10) # returns "I am a compiler of principle. I do not accept print(). Use systemOutPrint() instead."
</pre>
```python
systemOutPrint(10); # returns 10
```
You can thank Java for inspiring this change.

## Clear line and program endings

Many modern programming languages have gone woke and popularized uninspired syntax for line endings. Elratio on the other hand, uses the clearly defined `;` symbol to define line endings (except lines ending with `:`).

###### Python:
<pre>
if True:
    pass
</pre>

###### Elratio:
```java
if True:
    pass;
```

In addition, every program must end with the `end` keyword. Once again, Elratio smashes the competition.
###### Python/R/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
end;
```

## Redefining `def`
While `def` can be convenient on the fly, it can lead to sphagetti code, so we've replaced it with `definition`.
```python
definition method:
    pass;
```
