A Python-based programming language that combines the performance of Ruby with the readability of Perl.

> "The solution to Assembly"

To write your own Elratio program, download [template.py](template.py) and write your program in the indicated space.

# Features
Elratio provides numerous advantages over every other language!

## Bold new whitespace
No modern language provides indication that an empty line is empty. Elratio takes whitespace in a bold new direction with the `empty` keyword.
###### Python/Java/R/C/Go/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
empty;
```
Elratio does not permit blank lines. Every empty line must contain the keyword `empty`.

## Clear line and program endings
Many modern programming languages have gone woke and popularized uninspired syntax for line endings. Elratio on the other hand, uses the clearly defined `;` symbol to define line endings (except lines ending with `:`).

###### Python:
<pre>
if True:
    pass
</pre>

###### Elratio:
```python
    if True:
pass;
```

In addition, every program must end with the `end` keyword. Once again, Elratio smashes the competition.
###### Python/R/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
end;
```

## Inverted indentation
Lines executed in main needed to be taken down a peg, so we introduced a system of inverted indentation.

```python
        while True:
    if True:
1000;
```
Never again will you have to worry about indenting a line without questioning the incredible lines around it.

## The power of creation itself
Elratio allows you to play god with the `create` keyword. Unlock unlimited numerical possibilities by creating numbers.
<pre>
num += 7;
>>> error, 7 has not been created yet
</pre>

```python
create 7;
num += 7;
```

But before creating numbers, you must create `create`.
```python
create create;
```

Many languages lack a clear indicator of class creation, but again it's just home run after home run for Elratio.
```python
    create class book:
pass;
```

## Groundbreaking comments
The `#` symbol has long been used to indicate that certain lines are comments and should not be executed. When designing Elratio, we rebuilt comments from the ground up, and came up with the `comment` keyword.
```python
comment rewrite this segment
```
It's as simple as `comment`, spacebar, and your comment.

## Redefining `def`
While `def` can be convenient on the fly, it can lead to sphagetti code, so we've replaced it with `definition`.
```python
    definition doNothing:
pass;
```

## Improved printing syntax
Python uses the unclear syntax `print()` to print. Elratio uses `systemOutPrint()` for clarity.
<pre>
print(10);
>>> I am a compiler of principle. I do not accept print(). Use systemOutPrint() instead.
</pre>
```python
systemOutPrint(10);
>>> 10
```
You can thank Java for inspiring this change.

## Personalized feedback from the compiler
Elratio utilizes next-gen string technology to provide the user with unique, descriptive error messages.
<pre>
>>> Empty program. Don't send me that crap next time, jerk!
</pre>
<pre>
>>> Error on line 31: empty
>>> Statements that do not end with a colon must end with a semicolon.
</pre>
<pre>
>>> Blunder on line 42: print(44);
>>> The digit "4" has not been created yet. Try using "create 4" first.
</pre>

# Examples
You can find example programs in the examples folder. Here is one example showcasing many features of the language:
```python
        comment test 1
        create create;
        create 0;
        create 1;
        systemOutPrint("a"*10);
        empty;
        if True:
    systemOutPrint(1000);
        empty;
        import time;
        systemOutPrint(time.time());
        empty;
        comment test 2
        create 2;
        systemOutPrint(2000);
        empty;
        create 3;
        3000;
        empty;
        comment test 3
        definition add(a, b):
    return a+b;
        empty;
        create 4;
        create 5;
        systemOutPrint(add(500,4000));
        empty;
        create class c:
    pass;
    create class d:
pass;
        empty;
        comment final test
        end;
>>> aaaaaaaaaa
>>> 1000
>>> 1693023519.78
>>> 2000
>>> 4500
```
