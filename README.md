A Python-based programming language that combines the performance of Ruby with the readability of Perl.

> "The solution to Assembly"

To write your own Elratio program, download [template.py](template.py) and write your program in the indicated space.

# Features
Elratio provides numerous advantages over every other language!

## Bold new whitespace
No modern language provides indication that an empty line is empty. Elratio takes whitespace in a bold new direction with the `empty` keyword.
###### Python/Java/R/C/Go/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
empty;
```
Elratio does not permit blank lines. Every empty line must contain the keyword `empty`.

## Improved printing syntax
Python uses the unclear syntax `print()` to print. Elratio uses `systemOutPrint()` for clarity.
<pre>
print(10) # returns "I am a compiler of principle. I do not accept print(). Use systemOutPrint() instead."
</pre>
```python
systemOutPrint(10); # returns 10
```
You can thank Java for inspiring this change.

## Clear line and program endings

Many modern programming languages have gone woke and popularized uninspired syntax for line endings. Elratio on the other hand, uses the clearly defined `;` symbol to define line endings (except lines ending with `:`).

###### Python:
<pre>
if True:
    pass
</pre>

###### Elratio:
```java
if True:
    pass;
```

In addition, every program must end with the `end` keyword. Once again, Elratio smashes the competition.
###### Python/R/JavaScript:
<pre>

</pre>
###### Elratio:
```python
end;
```

## Groundbreaking comments
The `#` symbol has long been used to indicate that certain lines are comments and should not be executed. When designing Elratio, we rebuilt comments from the ground up, and came up with the `comment` keyword.
```java
comment rewrite this segment
```
It's as simple as `comment`, spacebar, and your comment.

## Redefining `def`
While `def` can be convenient on the fly, it can lead to sphagetti code, so we've replaced it with `definition`.
```python
definition doNothing:
    pass;
```

## Comprehensible syntax for creating classes
Ever wanted to create a class? Now you can with the `create` keyword. Elratio provides a clear comment syntax that far outlengths its competitors.
```python
create class book:
    pass;
```

## The power of creation itself
Elratio allows you to play god with the `create` keyword. Unlock unlimited numerical possibilities by creating numbers.
<pre>
z += 7; # error, 7 has not been created yet
</pre>

```python
create 7;
z += 7; # no error
```

But before creating numbers, you must create `create`.
```python
create create;
```
