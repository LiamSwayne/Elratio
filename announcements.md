# 2023/9/19 Announcement: Officially announcing that Announcementsâ„¢ will be announced [here](https://github.com/LiamSwayne/Elratio/discussions/5)!

As we take this great leap forward, we notice that we are gracefully moving backwards, back to a time of family values. We here at Elratio HQ, short for Half-witted Quitters, have decided to make announcements to engage with our community. But first, a moment of silence.
