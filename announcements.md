# 2023/10/15 Announcement: Un-firing the founder of Elratio.

To our community:

I’m Liam Swayne, and I lead the Elratio language which includes the Elratio compiler and template teams.

I want to start with this: I am sorry for firing myself.

I should have spoken with more of you and I should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing that I was firing myself. My goal with the firing was to ensure that the Elratio team could continue to support the community, and keep developers deeply invested in our language.

I will be un-firing myself, effective immediately. I suggest everyone migrate from Elratio to [Unity](https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee) until the Elratio team is reorganized.

# 2023/10/14 Announcement: I must come clean.

Hello Elratio community. I, Liam Swayne, creator of the Elratio language, have been propping up a falsehood at the heart of Elratio for a long time, and I just can't anymore. It's with a heavy heart that I admit I'm not a real programmer. All I know how to do is parse strings in Python. The vast majority of the Elratio compiler was written by ChatGPT, and the portions that were written by me only created technical debt that the bot was forced to build around later on. What started as a simple "L+Ratio" joke gradually became a thriving language, which I am no longer fit to lead into the future.

I will be taking an indefinite hiatus from the project until further notice. Thank you for sticking with Elratio even when it ran like crap. I hope to return one day, should the community allow it.

Thank you.

# 2023/9/19 Announcement: Officially announcing that Announcements™ will be announced [here](https://github.com/LiamSwayne/Elratio/discussions/5)!

As we take this great leap forward, we notice that we are gracefully moving backwards, back to a time of family values. We here at Elratio HQ, short for Half-witted Quitters, have decided to make announcements to engage with our community. But first, a moment of silence.

Damn. That's a lotta silence.
